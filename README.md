Heart Disease Prediction
🩺 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model that determines whether a patient has heart disease based on various clinical parameters. It is designed for healthcare professionals and data scientists to explore diagnostic insights using structured medical data.

📌 Problem Statement
Given a set of clinical features, can we accurately predict the presence of heart disease in a patient?

📊 Dataset
